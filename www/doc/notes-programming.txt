# Qualitative analysis

Solar Polar Flips produce magnetic fluctuations that affect Earth's magnetic field resulting in higher risk of mega-earthquakes.
See Davidson, U-Yen, Holloman papers in New Concepts in Global Tectonics Journal, Volume 3, Number 3 September 2015 for numerical analysis behind qualitative interpretation of latest imagery.

In summary:
Solar polar reversals tend to precede mega-earthquakes.
Corona holes are outward oriented magnetic lines of force emitting streams of charged particles.
Sunspots are localized erruptions of streams of charged particles that drive filaments.
Prominences are smaller, more localized activity with filaments etc. on a smaller scale.
Filaments produce synchrotron radiation.
Mixed polarity sunspots destabilize filaments.
Earth facing cornoa holes increase risk for earthquakes. 
Peak sunspot counts (prior to any decreasing count) after a solar minimum is indicative of same risk pattern.
Corona holes and large filaments are visible in ultraviolet spectrum.
Sunspots are mainly visible in visible spectrum.

Additionally, we can postulate that:
Changes in space current and magnetism around Earth can induce fluctuations in the Earth's magnetosphere.
The higher the rate of change and larger the magnitude of change, the greater the affect.

Some electromagnetics activity is observable via ground-based VLF and satellite OLR monitoring.

# Quantitative analysis

Given:

1 angstrom = 0.1 nm or 10E-10 meter
Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV or XUV) spectrum has range 10nm (124 eV) to 124nm (10eV).
Near Ultraviolet (NUV) spectrum has range 400nm to 300nm.
Middle Ultraviolet (MUV) spectrum has range 200nm to 300nm.
Far Ultraviolet (FUV) spectrum has range 122nm to 200nm.
Ultraviolet A (UVA) 315 to 400nm
Ultraviolet B (UVB) 280 to 315nm
Ultraviolet C (UVC) 100 to 280nm 

EUV and UVC is mostly absorbed by atmosphere, ozone etc.

Ultraviolet solar images include: 
  SDO's AIA 211, AIA 171, AIA 131, AIA 335, AIA 094
  SOHO's EIT 171, 195, 284, 304
                                 
Cornoa Holes visible in:
  SDO: AIA 211, AIA 094, AIA 335, AIA 131
  SOHO: EIT 195, EIT 284, EIT 171
