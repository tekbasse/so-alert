# Qualitative analysis

Solar Polar Flips produce magnetic fluctuations that affect Earth's magnetic field resulting in higher risk of mega-earthquakes.
See Davidson, U-Yen, Holloman papers in New Concepts in Global Tectonics Journal, Volume 3, Number 3 September 2015 for numerical analysis behind qualitative interpretation of latest imagery.

In summary:
Solar polar reversals tend to precede mega-earthquakes.
Corona holes are outward oriented magnetic lines of force emitting streams of charged particles.
Sunspots are localized erruptions of streams of charged particles that drive filaments.
Prominences are smaller, more localized activity with filaments etc. on a smaller scale.
Filaments produce synchrotron radiation.
Mixed polarity sunspots destabilize filaments.
Earth facing cornoa holes increase risk for earthquakes. 
Peak sunspot counts (prior to any decreasing count) after a solar minimum is indicative of same risk pattern.
Corona holes and large filaments are visible in ultraviolet spectrum.
Sunspots are mainly visible in visible spectrum.

Additionally, we can postulate that:
Changes in space current and magnetism around Earth can induce fluctuations in the Earth's magnetosphere.
The higher the rate of change and larger the magnitude of change, the greater the affect.

Some electromagnetics activity is observable via ground-based VLF and satellite OLR monitoring.

# Quantitative analysis

Any predictive process should be tested against historical data for accuracy.


BACKGROUND

Light spectrum properties:
Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV or XUV) spectrum has range 10nm (124 eV) to 124nm (10eV).
Near Ultraviolet (NUV) spectrum has range 400nm to 300nm.
Middle Ultraviolet (MUV) spectrum has range 200nm to 300nm.
Far Ultraviolet (FUV) spectrum has range 122nm to 200nm.
Ultraviolet A (UVA) 315 to 400nm
Ultraviolet B (UVB) 280 to 315nm
Ultraviolet C (UVC) 100 to 280nm 

EUV and UVC is mostly absorbed by atmosphere, ozone etc.

1 angstrom = 0.1 nm or 10E-10 meter


OBSERVATION SOURCES
Must be off Earth, since EUV and UVC are absorbed by atmosphere.

Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)


Solar (SOHO)



SDO and SOHO designate imagery by principle angstrom wavelength of detector or filter.

Ultraviolet solar image collections include: 
  SDO's AIA 211, AIA 171, AIA 131, AIA 335, AIA 094
  SOHO's EIT 171, 195, 284, 304
                                 
Cornoa Holes visible in these, listed in order of highest detection first:
  SDO: AIA 211, AIA 094, AIA 335, AIA 131
  SOHO: EIT 195, EIT 284, EIT 171


DATA -SOLAR


SDO test data from: www.lmsal.com/get_aia_data/
SDO is in a geosynchronous orbit with Earth.

SOHO test data from: 
SOHO orbits around L1.

SOHO and SDO are Earth facing, and so allow solutions
to avoid detailed orbital analysis such as 
via NASA'S NAIF SPICE software.

DATA -EARTHQUAKES

Earthquake data from IEB at http://ds.iris.edu/ieb/
Notable largest quakes while space probes actively monitor sun can be 
queried from server database soa_earthquakes.



ALGORITHMS

Any solution comparing two variables over time must be careful to show 
correlation without autocorrelation. 
One way to minimize time is to split data into discrete measures of duration over equal time.
By comparing two variables with respect to change over time instead
of comparing absolutes, time is no longer associated with a fixed place
in a timeline.

To see if a correlation exists between two variables A and B, 
split time so that the differential of A and B
over each time unit is consistent --positive or negative.
The spans of A and B should be split at the same points in time. 
Each split (delta time) does not have to be equal in duration,
but should be have a minimum duration where other durations are 
an whole number multiple of 1 or more of it.

Using this method, plotting longer trends helps to identify
signal from noise.


Index1: Discriminating Spot Amalgamator

This will assess risk by looking at the Earth facing disk, and 
assessing a value for each image pixel of the Solar disk,
and then assigning a significance based on position.
Pixel position indicates time before or after its meridian 
passes Earth, and its latitude relative to Earth's local orbital
segment during the same time.
parameters:
 position
 brightness


LOCAL LIBRARY

Some procedures will be shared between Algorithms. 

soa_reposition_sol_disk
  Possibly change image type, size and position of disk to fit system normalized image specs
  This page shows that perspective changes definitely should be considered:
  http://sdoisgo.blogspot.com/2016/01/january-maneuvers.html

  Size is usually consistent since it's largely determined by perspective,
  but I recall times when 512 images were used in place of larger ones on some feeds, 
  which means that size should not always be assumed.

  For determining diameter and disk edges, 
  scan image to create a horizontal and vertical brightness profile 
  perhaps by collecting an ordered set of subtotals of brightness of each pixel row and column.
  This should result in a pattern that can discern a disk edge which can be used to create a mathematical definition of the outline.



soa_0deg_motion 
   This will detect the motion between some significant points near the disk center
and return a motion vector. It will be used to detect any change in polar orientation of image.
Initial plan is:
   get image1 and image2
   grab N number of distinctly bright or dim pixels from central box in image1 of about 14deg; 
   N is circa 9 or 12, 14degrees covers significant change in Earth position relative to Sun's equatorial plane.
   N may start with all points, remove possible brightness outliers and statistically common ones.
   Deterime the max distance between all the remaining points.
   Remove all points that are close to each other.. ie identify N points with max separation.
   Identify search field of image2, about equal to length of image1_central_box times 3 with same center point.
   --This is to cover motion in any direction.
   Identify N2 pixes similar to image1 pixels, where N2= N * surface area of image2_central_box / area of image1_central_box
   calc distance between all N2 points.
   Filter out all point distances where N2 distances are greater than N's and less than N's (allow for some drift)
   Filter out all points that are referenced less than n-1 times.
   If more than one cluster of matching points remain, compare the most distance cases of N2 with N1's and
   compare the least distant cases of N2 with N1's. 
   Using a bias of N points right of center, find cases where the motion vector is most consistent. 
   Consider using least squares with N points and check against least squares of N2 points to find similar pattern.
   Calculate and return the motion vector for each N to N2 points.
   
soa_rotate_solar_disk_q
   Determine if image needs rotated by analyzing vectors.
   The longest vectors will be closer to the solar equator
   The right most points will likely indicate orientation of the arc of the solar equator (if Earth inclined).
   Average left most ones to determine incoming motion
   compare with ones from recent image history 
   Rotate image if necessary.

soa_analyze_risk_vX
   Scan new image and assess risk.
