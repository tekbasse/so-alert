SO Alert
========

A Sun monitoring system

The lastest version of the code is available at site:
 http://github.com/tekbasse/so-alert

introduction
------------

This package analyses a series of solar disk images to
assess risk of solar induced Earth events using quantified metrics.


Ben Davidson of SuspicousObservers.org 
inspired me to write this initial version
when he published a request for a methodology to 
quantify an aspect of his daily qualitative analysis of 
solar monitoring. This is one way.
